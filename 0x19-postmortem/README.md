# Postmortem

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** February 14, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM (UTC-5).
- **Impact:** The main web application was completely inaccessible for all users, affecting approximately 80% of our customer base.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an overload of traffic to one of the application servers, causing it to crash and subsequently disrupt the entire service.

**Timeline:**

- **10:00 AM:** Issue detected through a surge in error rate alerts on the monitoring dashboard.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineering team notified of the outage by the monitoring system.
- **10:10 AM:** Initial investigation focused on database performance due to recent updates.
- **10:30 AM:** Misleading assumption made that recent code changes might have introduced a bug.
- **10:45 AM:** Incident escalated to the infrastructure team for further investigation.
- **11:00 AM:** Load balancer logs reviewed, revealing unusual traffic patterns.
- **11:15 AM:** Load balancer configuration checked and identified misconfigured settings.
- **12:00 PM:** Load balancer configuration corrected to distribute traffic evenly across application servers.
- **12:30 PM:** Service fully restored after load balancer configuration fix.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the outage was traced to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing an imbalance in traffic distribution. Specifically, one of the application servers was overwhelmed with traffic, leading to its failure and subsequent service disruption.

To resolve the issue, the misconfigured settings in the load balancer were corrected to ensure balanced traffic distribution across all application servers. This prevented overloading of any individual server and restored normal service functionality.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  1. Implement automated checks for load balancer configuration consistency to catch misconfigurations before they cause service disruptions.
  2. Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more detailed insights into traffic patterns and server performance.
  3. Conduct regular load testing to identify potential weaknesses in the infrastructure before they impact production environments.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Develop and implement automated load balancer configuration validation scripts.
  2. Update monitoring system to include more granular metrics for traffic analysis.
  3. Schedule regular load testing exercises to assess system scalability and resilience.

By implementing these corrective measures and addressing the outlined tasks, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the reliability and stability of our services for our customers.
